# ThreeStrokes
Algorithm to find solutions to draw a character in three strokes. This question was brought home by my dad when I was a kid and I tried very hard to solve it, but to no avail. Here I tried using R to mimic human drawing strategy to find potential solutions. The algorithm runs for 10000 times and concludes no solution.
