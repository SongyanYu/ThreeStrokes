# Three Strokes to Draw a Character/Figure
Algorithm to find solutions to draw a character in three strokes. The character is as below:

### Background
This question was brought home by my dad when I was a kid and I tried very hard to solve it, but to no avail. Here I tried using R to mimic human drawing strategy to find potential solutions. The algorithm runs for 10000 times and concludes no solution.

### Reach out
I'm keen to know if you encountered the same/similar question before, or you know the answer to my question, no matter if it is a definite 'no solution' or 'here is the solution'. Feel free to reach out to me via <yusongyan1989@gmail.com>.
